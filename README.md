Scene Navigation Controller 

• API to load and unload scenes 
• Stack to keep track of the previously loaded scenes, so unloading will take you directly to the previously loaded scene 
• Multiple Scene Transition Options are avaialble; FadeIn, FadeOut, Sprite Animation, etc (you can always custom ones in the SceneTransitionUtility.cs class)
• This plugin uses CySharp/MessagePipe for the event system as well as VContainer for dependency injection
